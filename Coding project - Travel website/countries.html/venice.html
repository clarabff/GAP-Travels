                  <p>Venice is one of the most beautiful and unique cities anywhere in the whole world. This city made up 118 islands and 400 bridges is a fairytale world like nowhere else on earth and somewhere you have to visit at least once in your lifetime. However Venice has become a victim of its own popularity and in recent years has suffered from massive overtourism. Visiting Venice when busy and crowded is not fun and you could very easily leave hating the city that you wanted to visit so much.

                    However Venice is what you make of it and by doing a little research and planning ahead of time, you can avoid crowds and fellow tourists, overpriced food and drink and your trip to Venice can easily be the magical experience you want it to be. I have written this blog and travel guide and tried to include as much information, helpful hints, tips and advice as I can to help anyone planning a trip to Venice.                  <div class="btn-toolbar text-center">

                  <h3 class="">How to get to Venice</h3>
                  <p>Marco Polo Airport (VCE) is located five miles north of the city and is the main airport serving Venice. From the airport you can either take either the cheap and easy ATVO or ACTV bus to Piazzale Roma, the Alilaguna water shuttle boat to several destinations in the city or a much more expensive private water taxi to your destination. The other airport is Treviso (TSF) which is located twenty miles from Venice and is mainly used by low cost airlines. You can reach Piazzale Roma in the city from here by using the ATVO or Barzi Service bus.

                    You can also arrive into Venezia Santa Lucia railway station which is located in the city itself on high speed trains from major cities across Italy. However if staying in the city, do not get off the train at Venezia Mestre as this station is located on the mainland – stay on the train and the next and final stop will be Venezia Santa Lucia.
                    
                    If driving to Venice, you will either have to leave your car on the mainland in Mestre and take either the bus or train over the bridge into the city or park your car in one of the more expensive multi story car parks located in Piazzale Roma. If doing the latter option, make sure to book your parking ahead of time as they will be busy                    </p>

                  <h3 class="">Getting around Venice</h3>
                  <p>As it can get very busy and crowded in Venice, it is wise to have an idea of how to explore the city. Whilst it is possible to see limited highlights of Venice in one day, you will need longer to be able to see any more or to explore in more detail. Whilst Venice is not huge, it does take time to get around (there are only four bridges across the whole of the Grand Canal and they are further apart than what you think) so the best way to see everything is to break up your sightseeing into the different neighbourhoods (Cannaregio, Santa Croce, San Marco, Dorsoduro, Castello and San Polo) and take your time to see each one before moving onto the next.

                    Try to start exploring Venice as early as possible in the morning before all of the crowds arrive and once again in the late afternoon and into the evening once everyone has left the city. The streets of Venice in the evening are silent and you feel like you are in another world as you walk through the empty squares and along the empty maze-like alleyways and by the canals – it’s like travelling back to another time. The best advice in Venice is to not follow the crowds and to avoid the popular areas such as St Mark’s Square and the Rialto Bridge in the middle of the day – use this time to explore the back streets and the less popular areas which are simply beautiful and definitely worth visiting.                    <a href="#" role="button" class="btn btn-primary pull-right">Details</a>

                    <h3 class="">Things to do in Venice</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <h3>Grand canal</h3>
                        <p>During the high season, the water buses that troll up and down the Grand Canal can be oppressively crowded, especially during morning and evening commutes. Avoid the chaos by travelling the Grand Canal at night, a beautiful option as all the regal palaces are lit up, making the ceiling frescos and grand chandeliers visible.

                            Another way to bypass the throngs of tourists on the Grand Canal is to hire your own water taxi. Some boats even serve onboard champagne. This indulgence is pricier than public transport, but it is a great idea if you're travelling with a group and want to indulge in water-borne transport (it is often cheaper than gondolas, too). Water taxis are also easier to navigate down smaller, scenic canals. Plus, as it is only your group onboard, you can slow for photos as often as you like.                            
                        <li>
                        <h3>Caffè Florian</h3>
                        <p>Set in the heart of San Marco Square, Caffé Florian is legendary. This iconic slice of Venetian history has been a hallmark of royalty since 1720, attracting celebrities over the centuries from Charlie Chaplin to Andy Warhol, and its décor hasn’t changed much since the 18th century. Try the risotto or, for something sweet, the gourmet chocolates, speciality coffees and ice-cold gelato. The patio is perfect in the summer.

                        <li>
                        <h3>San Sebastiano</h3>
                        <p>Millions loiter outside San Marco every year, waiting for their turn to catch a glimpse of the fabulously overwrought basilica. Why not instead take a detour to the church of San Sebastiano, where some of Venetian Renaissance master Paolo Tiepolo’s greatest works can be found. Save Venice Inc., the non-profit responsible for the restoration of countless Venetian artworks and architecture across the city (such as the brilliant marble facade of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli), recently restored Tiepolo’s ceiling paintings, and has spent over a decade repairing and restoring much of the church.                        </li>
