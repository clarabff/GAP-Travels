                  <p>VWithin minutes of arriving in Budapest, you’ll notice its flamboyant architecture. Often called the “Paris of the East”, you can’t help but appreciate what a beautiful city it is, built on either side of the Danube River with grand buildings and centuries-old thermal baths. Seeing that side of Budapest sort of conditions your mind to expect an historical, though perhaps unexciting experience.

                    But nothing can be further from the truth.
                    
                    Spend a day exploring the Pest side and you’ll quickly realize that there is so much more to Budapest than its gargoyles and complex past. Its classical facade belies an energy and grit that we didn’t feel in other European cities.                    <a href="#" role="button" class="btn btn-primary pull-right">Details</a>

                  <h3 class="">How to get to Budapest</h3>
                  <p>Marco Polo Airport (VCE) is located five miles north of the city and is the main airport serving Venice. From the airport you can either take either the cheap and easy ATVO or ACTV bus to Piazzale Roma, the Alilaguna water shuttle boat to several destinations in the city or a much more expensive private water taxi to your destination. The other airport is Treviso (TSF) which is located twenty miles from Venice and is mainly used by low cost airlines. You can reach Piazzale Roma in the city from here by using the ATVO or Barzi Service bus.

                    You can also arrive into Venezia Santa Lucia railway station which is located in the city itself on high speed trains from major cities across Italy. However if staying in the city, do not get off the train at Venezia Mestre as this station is located on the mainland – stay on the train and the next and final stop will be Venezia Santa Lucia.
                    
                    If driving to Venice, you will either have to leave your car on the mainland in Mestre and take either the bus or train over the bridge into the city or park your car in one of the more expensive multi story car parks located in Piazzale Roma. If doing the latter option, make sure to book your parking ahead of time as they will be busy                    </p>

                  <h3 class="">Getting around Budapest</h3>
                  <p>Thanks to plentiful buses, boats, trams and Metro trains, getting around Budapest is easy. The Hungarian capital is highly walkable, and for the times when you need to go farther afield or get somewhere quickly, there are plenty of transport options.

                    Budapest Közlekedési Központ (BKK) runs the city’s transport network, which includes metro lines, trams, buses and even boats in the summer. BKK has a handy app for journey planning, so you can see when the next bus, tram, boat or metro is scheduled to arrive – it's particularly useful in winter, when temperatures regularly drop below -1°C (30°F).
                    
                    Whatever time of year you come, here are the best ways to get around Budapest.
                    
                    Pick up a travel card or transport pass for cheap journeys in Budapest
                    On Budapest public transport, you can buy a ticket for a single journey or buy a travel pass valid for anything from 24 hours to a month, covering all forms of public transportation run by BKK. Prices start at 1650 HUF (US$5) for 24 hours. The Budapest Card also includes travel on public transport, as well as free entry to sights and attractions; it costs from 6,490 HUF (US$20) for 24 hours.
                    
                    You can buy tickets for public transport from ticket offices in metro stations or at the purple self-service ticket machines at most metro, bus and tram stops. If you get a single ticket, make sure you validate it when you enter the metro station or get on board the bus or tram.                  </div>

                    <h3 class="">Things to do in Budapest</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <h3>Buda castle</h3>
                        <p>They call it a castle, but it’s more of a palace complex than anything else. Though it was originally constructed in the 13th century, the huge Baroque complex you see today was built between 1749 and 1769. The palace’s days of being a luxurious living space ended in World War II, though, when Nazi (and then Russian) troops looted it. Today, it’s home to a collection of museums (see below).


                            Beneath the castle, Vlad the Impaler (who we know colloquially as Count Dracula) was apparently imprisoned here for 14 years. In the dungeon area, there is a labyrinth that tourists can explore.                        <li>
                        <h3>Budapest History Museum</h3>
                        <p>This museum covers four floors of Buda Castle and really gives you a comprehensive overview of the city’s entire history (plus the views across town are amazing!). It has some rooms that date back to the 15th century, and you can also explore the old cellar, which also dates to the 15th century. Personally, I really liked the “1,000 Years of Budapest” area.
                        <li>
                        <h3>Hungarian National Gallery</h3>
                        <p>Opened in 1957, this museum focuses on Hungarian artists and history, of which I knew very little before my visit. There are a lot of treasures here: besides the paintings and sculptures, you can see a collection of altarpieces from the 1400s and tour the building’s dome. To see what new temporary exhibits are on display, check the website.                    </ul>
