 ​                        ​<​h3​>​Eiffel tower​</​h3​> 
 ​                        ​<​p​>​Lovingly called the most romantic city in the world, Paris is unlike any other city. Sporting mindblowing Nouveau architecture and magnificent cobbled streets, the French capital is a treasure trove of multifarious experiences. The City of Lights is home to quite a few iconic monuments and landmarks — the revered Notre Dame Cathedral, the spectacular Louvre Museum, the palatial Sacré-Cœur and the most emblematic of them all, the stupendous Eiffel Tower.

The iconic steel structure is the first thing to come to your mind when you think of Paris. Built originally to last only 20 years, the tower has been a symbol of French technological prowess, engineering and architecture for over a century now. Inspiring millions of the city’s residents every night with its glimmering beacon, the Eiffel Tower is a majestic emblem of hope and wonder that one must visit in their lifetime.  ​                             
 ​                        ​<​li​> 
 ​                        ​<​h3​>​The Louvre​</​h3​> 
 ​                        ​<​p​>​The Louvre was first built as a fortress to protect Paris from Viking attacks in the 12th century. In 1546, it became home to the French monarchs. In 1789, during the French Revolution, it was decided that The Louvre would be home to the country’s art. Since then, the museum has become world-famous as the holy shrine of art.

The Louvre is home to over 3,80,000 artworks, of which only 35,000 make up the permanent exhibition. These exhibits are spread across eight departments - Egyptian Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Islamic Art; Decorative Arts; Sculpture; Paintings; Drawings and Prints.

Considered as the world's best and largest art museum, it is only natural to visit Louvre, Paris to experience and see the finest artworks. From paintings from centuries ago to the newest artworks from today's admirable artists, you can find all forms and styles of art in the Louvre Museum. 
 ​                        ​<​li​> 
 ​                        ​<​h3​>​Arc De Triomphe​</​h3​> 
 ​                        ​<​p​>​At the far end of Champs Elysées, you can't help but notice the towering arch soaring over the traffic at Place Charles de Gaulle. The Arc de Triomphe, dominating the horizon was commissioned by Napolean as a homage to the army of France. There are over 660 names of generals and members of the army engraved on the insides of the arch. Visiting this historic symbol of Parisian pomp and military triumph must definitely make the cut to your Paris itinerary. ​                        ​</​li​>
