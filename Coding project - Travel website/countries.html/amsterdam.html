                  <h3 class="">A complete guide</h3>
                  <p>Amsterdam is up there with our favourite cities in Europe. If you haven’t yet been, it’s time you started planning your adventure there.

                    The city of Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands, host to a 17th Century Canal ring that is listed as a UNESCO Heritage Site and is simply a playground of activities for both adults and families.
                    
                    We were lucky enough to have visited Amsterdam already and fell even more in love the second time round. The abundance of canals and arched bridges that you can wander aimlessly through and dine upon, the rows of stunning apartments and townhouses that line the canals, the variety of markets and shopping districts, the healthy cafes and rooftop cocktail bars… Amsterdam just seems to have it ALL.<br><br>
                
                    If you happen to time your visit during the spring, you will get to witness the prettiest landscapes as the tulips blossom all over the city in a rainbow of colour.

                    Admittedly, if you head to Amsterdam unaware and without having done any research beforehand, you can be easily led into some tourist traps, some tacky bars and some seedy settings.

                    Like with any popular city, and particularly because the nightlife is a popular attraction here in Amsterdam, it does attract groups of stags and hens and you are likely to come across a few drunken backpackers BUT if you read this guide… you can easily avoid it all during your stay. <br> <br>

                  <h3 class="">How to get to Amsterdam</h3>
                  <p>Amsterdam’s main airport is Amsterdam Schiphol which is accessible from all over Europe with a direct flight.<br><br>

                    
                    Getting from the airport into the city centre:
                    From the airport you have a few options:<br><br>
                    
                    Direct train from the airport to Amsterdam Centraal station (every 15 minutes in the day, every hour at night) (5.50€, +1€ if you get a disposable ticket. You can get a plastic card to load credit onto, similar to Oyster, to avoid this!)
                    Bus (every 30 minutes during the day) (3.60€)
                    Direct shuttle options (often run by hotels or mini bus companies). There are loads, so have a look online. From what I can gather, it’s between 10-25€ depending on the service you want.
                    Private taxi (approximately 40-50€)
                    If you’re looking to arrive by train the main city train station is Amsterdam Centraal.</p>

                  <h3 class="">Getting around Amsterdam</h3>
                  <p>When it comes to exploring Amsterdam, bikes are the go-to for most tourists and pretty much all of the locals. The whole city sits pretty flat and is simply a network of canals, making cycling a simple and effective way to get around. It’s such a popular option that, alongside the majority of the roads, there are bikes lanes assigned so that cyclists have their own territory to manoeuvre in.

                    Due to the popularity of cycling and therefore the volume of cyclists out and about, particularly in the summer, the bike lanes can get pretty hectic and you will need to be paying full attention when using them.
                    
                    Walking is another popular and beautiful way to get around when exploring Amsterdam. A simple wander around the canals and shops will have you occupied for a few hours, if not the whole day {photographer heaven}. The city is pretty big though, so if you are tight on time or are looking to cover multiple attractions – consider hiring a bike.
                    
                    We hired our bikes, on the day of rental, from Yellow bikes which cost €12 for 24 hours. Be sure to check with your hostel / hotel for bike deals, some of them even have free bikes included in your stay.
                    
                    If not, public transport is widely available. If you think that you’ll be using it a lot, think about getting an Amsterdam City card. It’s not cheap, starting at €60, but includes unlimited transport and many free attractions during your stay in Amsterdam.</p>

                    <h3 class="">Things to do in Amsterdam</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        <h3>Rent a bike</h3>
                        <p>The absolute best way to get around this city is by bike. Don't be alarmed! There are lots and lots of bikers… EVERYWHERE. But this bike friendly city means it's easy to rent (we have used both Black Bikes and Yellow Bike) and return your bike. The fastest and prettiest way to see the sights by far. Truly, it's the best way to live like a local.</p>
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>
                        <h3>Explore the Rijksmuseum</h3>
                        <p>A collection of Rembrandt, Vermeer, and more, this extensive museum has some of the finest art in the world. It's also situated next to the Van Gogh museum so you can kill two museums in one go. Or Gogh. Sorry, had to do it.</p>
                        </li>
                
                        <li>
                        <h3>Take a boat tour</h3>
                        <p>One of the best ways to see the city is to explore by boat. I recommend a cruise that includes drinks (usually priced at 15 euros including drinks for one hour). Cruise around sunset for scenic views and watch the city transform and light up at night. The canals are a Unesco World Heritage site and it will give you a good grasp of the city and its founding.

 

                            Amsterdam is one of those cities you could truly spend a month in, and still have so much to see. It's one of the coolest cities both historically and continues to make its mark today. The golden canals, legendary nightlife, quirky and fun shops, mixed with the free spirit of the city make it one of the best in Europe. I can see why it's so crowded!</p>
